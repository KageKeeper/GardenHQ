# GardenHQ
==============
The one stop repository for all your Garden info
---------------

I am an avid gardener, and as such I collect and compile an enormous amount of data. Such as:
- Type of plant (seed) planted
- Location in Garden where seed was planted
- Date seed was planted
- Date seed germinated
- Date and type of fertilizer and other amendments added to Garden
- Amount of produce harvested
- Soil testing data
- Etc....

I am using ASP.NET MVC5 to acheive a pleasant and intuitive Gardening application where all this data can be stored, and easily retrieved 
and displayed. I intend to use the data stored over time to produce informative graphs and other helpful information for Gardeners everywhere!
